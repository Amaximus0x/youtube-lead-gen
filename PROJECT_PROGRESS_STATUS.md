- ✅ Visits `/videos` tab for each channel
- ✅ **Multi-method extraction** (5 different approaches):
  - Method 1: Parse header format (`@handle • 18.2K subscribers • 1.7K videos`)
  - Method 2: Find `#subscriber-count` element
  - Method 3: Search for "subscribers" pattern
  - Method 4: Search for "videos" pattern
  - Method 5: Extract description from meta tags
- ✅ Handles numbers with K/M/B suffixes
- ✅ Extracts contact info using `contact-extractor.ts`

**Contact Extractor** (`contact-extractor.ts`):
