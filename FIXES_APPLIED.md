# Fixes Applied - YouTube Lead Generation

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Scraper Only Extracting 20 Channels (Expected 50)

**Problem**:
```
Extraction returned 20 channels
No more new channels, stopping scroll
```

**Root Cause**:
- YouTube lazy-loads content as you scroll
- Previous code only waited 500ms-1500ms between scrolls
- Gave up after first failed scroll attempt
- Used `scrollBy()` instead of scrolling to bottom

**Solution Applied**:
File: `src/lib/server/youtube/scraper-puppeteer.ts` (lines 165-200)

1. **Changed scroll method**:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   window.scrollBy(0, window.innerHeight)

   // After
   window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)
   ```

2. **Increased wait time**:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime)); // 500-1500ms

   // After
   await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, isServerless ? 1000 : 2000)); // 1-2 seconds
   ```

3. **Added retry logic**:
   ```typescript
   let noNewChannelsCount = 0;

   if (uniqueNewChannels.length === 0) {
       noNewChannelsCount++;
       console.log(`No new channels found (attempt ${noNewChannelsCount}/3)`);

       // Try 3 times before giving up
       if (noNewChannelsCount >= 3) {
           break;
       }
   } else {
       noNewChannelsCount = 0; // Reset on success
       channels.push(...uniqueNewChannels);
       console.log(`Found ${uniqueNewChannels.length} new channels (total: ${channels.length})`);
   }
   ```

**Expected Result**:
- Should now find 50+ channels per search
- Will try up to 3 times when no new channels appear
- Better logging shows progress

### Issue 2: Database Not Available Error

**Problem**:
```
POST http://localhost:5173/api/youtube/load-more 500 (Internal Server Error)
Load more error: Error: Database not available
```

**Root Cause**:
- Environment variables not loaded when dev server started
- `.env` file exists with correct credentials
- But `supabase` client initialized as `null`

**Solution Applied**:
File: `src/routes/api/youtube/load-more/+server.ts` (lines 17-30)

Added better error debugging:
```typescript
if (!supabase) {
    console.error('[LoadMore] Supabase client is null!');
    console.error('[LoadMore] SUPABASE_URL:', process.env.SUPABASE_URL ? 'SET' : 'NOT SET');
    console.error(
        '[LoadMore] SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY:',
        process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY ? 'SET' : 'NOT SET'
    );
    return json(
        {
            error: 'Database not available. Please restart the dev server to load environment variables.'
        },
        { status: 500 }
    );
}
```

**Required Action**:
⚠️ **RESTART YOUR DEV SERVER** ⚠️

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

Environment variables are only loaded when the server starts!

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test 50+ Channels Extraction

**Search for "IELTS"**

Expected console output:
```
Extracted 20 channels
Found 5 new channels (total: 25)
Found 8 new channels (total: 33)
Found 10 new channels (total: 43)
Found 7 new channels (total: 50)
No new channels found (attempt 1/3)
No new channels found (attempt 2/3)
No new channels found (attempt 3/3)
No more new channels after 3 attempts, stopping scroll
Total found: 50 channels for keyword: IELTS
Getting accurate stats for first 15 channels...
```

**What to check**:
- [ ] Should see "Total found: 50 channels" (or more)
- [ ] Should see retry attempts when scrolling
- [ ] Should see "Found X new channels (total: Y)" incrementing
- [ ] First 15 channels get enriched (stats extraction)

### 3. Test Load More Button

**Click "Load More Channels"**

Expected console output:
```
[LoadMore] Loading page 2 for keyword: IELTS
```

**What to check**:
- [ ] No "Database not available" error
- [ ] Should see 30 total channels (15 + 15)
- [ ] All channels have subscriber/video counts
- [ ] "Load More" button still shows if more channels available

### 4. Verify Database Persistence

**Search same keyword again**

Expected behavior:
- [ ] Should load faster (from database)
- [ ] "Load More" should be instant (no re-scraping)
- [ ] Same channels appear

---

## What Changed

### Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/server/youtube/scraper-puppeteer.ts`**
   - Lines 165-200: Better scrolling with retry logic
   - Increased wait times
   - Better progress logging

2. **`src/routes/api/youtube/load-more/+server.ts`**
   - Lines 17-30: Better error messages
   - Environment variable debugging

### Expected Behavior Now

**Initial Search (50 channels)**:
```
1. Scrape YouTube search (finds 20)
2. Scroll + wait 2 seconds
3. Scrape again (finds 25 total)
4. Scroll + wait 2 seconds
5. Scrape again (finds 33 total)
   ... continues until 50 or 3 failed attempts
6. Enrich first 15 channels (~15 seconds)
7. Return to user
```

**Load More**:
```
1. Fetch channels 16-30 from database
2. Check if stats exist
3. If not: Enrich from /about pages (~15 seconds)
4. Return enriched channels
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Still Getting "Database not available"

**Solution**: Restart dev server
```bash
# Kill current process
Ctrl+C

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### Still Only Getting 20 Channels

**Possible causes**:
1. YouTube not showing more results for that keyword
   - Try different keyword (e.g., "cooking", "tech reviews")

2. Max scrolls reached
   - Check `maxScrolls` in scraper (line 167)
   - For limit=50, should allow ~5 scrolls

3. Server timeout
   - Check if running in serverless mode
   - Serverless limited to 20 channels

**Debug**:
Look for these console logs:
```
Found X new channels (total: Y)
No new channels found (attempt 1/3)
```

If you see "attempt 1/3" immediately, YouTube didn't load more content.

### Load More Returns Empty

**Cause**: Database doesn't have channels for that keyword

**Solution**:
1. Search first to populate database
2. Then "Load More" should work

---

## Performance Expectations

### Initial Search
- **Scraping 50 channels**: ~10-20 seconds
- **Enriching first 15**: ~15 seconds
- **Total**: ~25-35 seconds

### Load More (from database)
- **Already enriched**: ~0.5 seconds (instant)
- **Need enrichment**: ~15 seconds (15 channels)

### Repeat Search (same keyword)
- **All from database**: ~1-2 seconds (very fast!)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Restart dev server
2. ✅ Test search for 50+ channels
3. ✅ Test "Load More" button works
4. ✅ Verify database persistence

If issues persist:
1. Check terminal for environment variable logs
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify `.env` file has correct credentials
4. Try different search keywords

---

## Summary

**Fixes Applied**:
1. ✅ Better scrolling logic (scroll to bottom, not incremental)
2. ✅ Increased wait times (2 seconds instead of 0.5-1.5s)
3. ✅ Retry logic (3 attempts before giving up)
4. ✅ Better error messages for database issues
5. ✅ Progress logging to track channel extraction

**Action Required**:
⚠️ **RESTART DEV SERVER** to load environment variables

The system should now correctly extract 50+ channels and pagination should work!
